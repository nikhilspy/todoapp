# todo_app

The goal of this project is to build a todo app using Django, a powerful web framework for Python. The app will allow users to create and manage their own todo lists, adding and completing tasks as needed. It will also provide features such as email notifications, task prioritization, and the ability to group tasks into projects.

To accomplish this, the project will use Django to build a web application with a user-friendly interface and a database to store the tasks and other data. It will also incorporate features such as email notifications, task prioritization, and the ability to group tasks into projects, using Django's built-in capabilities and potentially integrating with third-party libraries or APIs.

The todo app will be designed to be easy to use and customize, with a clean and intuitive interface. It will also be built with security in mind, incorporating measures such as user authentication and data encryption to protect the users' data.

Overall, this project aims to create a feature-rich and user-friendly todo app using Django, providing a powerful tool for organizing and managing tasks.
